#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Updated 8/17/2016

# This bash script takes the name of the executable as the only command line
# argument (e.g. chart)
# It assumes that the named executable is in the current directory.
# It also assumes that you have a subdirectory named tests that contains
# all of the posted tests and the expected result files.
#
# This script will create a new directory called results.  It will put 
# the results of running the tests (.myout and .myerr files) into the 
# results directory.  Then it will compare your output (.myout and .myerr
# in the results directory) with the posted output (.out and .err in the 
# tests directory).

# if a command line argument is not given, look at the directory and
# try to find the expected executable
# this is a terrible hack, I'm avoiding bash arrays
